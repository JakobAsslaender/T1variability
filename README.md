This code reproduces all results in the paper [Magnetization transfer explains most of the T1 variability in the MRI literature][arXiv-url1]. Please go to the [Documentation][docs-url] for a detailed description of the code.

The code is written in the open-source language Julia and is structured as follows:
- Fit_qMT_to_literatureT1.jl is the main script and implements the pulse sequence simulations and the mono-exponential fitting routines. It also calls the fit of the qMT models to the variable literature T1 estimates.
- helper_functions.jl contains implementations of RF pulses and some helper functions, which are less relevant for understanding the simulations
- Project.toml and Manifest.toml contain information about the packages used by the simulation, facilitating their automated installation.

Julia can be downloaded from the website https://julialang.org or, on Unix systems, installed by simply calling

    `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`

from the command line.

In order to run the simulations, place all four files in the same folder and call

    `julia -iq --threads=auto some_path/Fit_qMT_to_literatureT1.jl`

replacing `some_path` with the path to the files. For a more interactive interface, the code can be called from Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension.
